Concert Ticket Management System Using C++ Programming Language

The Concert Ticket Management System is a program developed in C++ language that enables efficient management of concert ticket sales and user information. The system incorporates a login system to differentiate between the manager and regular users, allowing each to access specific functionalities.

Upon launching the program, users are prompted to log in as either a manager or a regular user. The login system ensures that managers and users have separate accounts and privileges within the system. Once logged in, the manager gains access to a range of features. The system utilizes structures and switch statements to organize and retrieve data. The manager can check and manage employee details. They can also view information about the singers performing in the concert, such as their names and performance times. Also, the manager has access to guard details, which includes position, as well as vendor details like vendor names and quantity.

Users, on the other hand, have a more limited set of functionalities. They can view details about the concert singers, including their names, performance times, and possibly even brief descriptions of their performances. Additionally, users can book tickets for the concert. The project offers three ticket categories: gold, silver, and platinum, each with different pricing and benefits. Users can choose the desired category and specify the number of tickets they wish to purchase.

After the user selects the tickets and confirms the purchase, the system calculates the total bill based on the number of tickets and the prices associated with the chosen ticket category. The bill is generated and displayed to the user, providing a clear overview of the total cost.
